- 👋 Hi, I’m @misterholt
- 👀 I’m interested in learning, coding, libertarian philosophy, woodworking, languages, making Texas it's own republic again. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning html/css
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing at the moment but I'll post requests if there is a place for that.
- 📫 How to reach me, the fastest way is through my email: ryan.holt725@outlook.com. I check it every morning so please allow 24hrs. 
- I am a Christian but unlike most I am knowledgable in the apologetics of the religion, I will not disrespect your beliefs, I will only ask questions.
